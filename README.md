## Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

You will need the standard data science libraries found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>
In this project, I build a few machine learning models to predict how consumers of Starbucks respond to promotional offers, so that offers will be sent out effectively. Specifically, I aim to answer these four questions: 

* Who responds to promotional offers (including all types)? - A logistic model
* For people responding to different types of offers, how do their demographic characteristics differ?
* If a person responds to an offer, how long does it take for him/her to complete the offer? How does this period differ for differnt offers?
* If a person responds to an offer, how much would he/she spend based on demographics and offer type?
