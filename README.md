## Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

You will need the standard data science libraries found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>
In this project, I aim to answer six business questions regarding house/apartment listsing on Airbnb in Seattle, WA, US: 
1. How has Airbnb listing price on average changed over time, both across years and within a single year? 
2. How long are the houses listed on Airbnb a year and how has that changed over time? This question allows us to tell whether there are any landlords that list their houses on Airbnb fulltime. 
3. How do Airbnb prices respond to holidays? How much do they differ from normal daily average? 
4. How are the prices differ across region (neighborhood and zipcode)? Which zipcodes are the most expensive?
5. What are the most important factors that affect Airbnb homes' price? 
6. What types of homes are listed on Airbnb? Hotel, motel, single family homes, apartments or other types?
